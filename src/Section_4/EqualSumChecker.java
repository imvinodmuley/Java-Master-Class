/*
 * Write a method hasEqualSum with 3 parameters of type int.
 * 
 * The method should return boolean and it needs to return true if the sum of
 * the first and second parameter is equal to the third parameter. Otherwise,
 * return false.
 * 
 * 
 * EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:
 * 
 * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 1); should return false since 1 + 1 is not equal to 1
 * 
 * hasEqualSum(1, 1, 2); should return true since 1 + 1 is equal to 2
 * 
 * hasEqualSum(1, -1, 0); should return true since 1 + (-1) is 1 - 1 and is
 * equal to 0
 * 
 * 
 * NOTE: The hasEqualSum method needs to be defined as public static like we
 * have been doing so far in the course. NOTE: Do not add a main method to
 * solution code.
